At the bottom of this document are the requirements for a database application. I designed and implemented an Oracle application that satisfies these requirements. 
This includes setting up a database schema and providing access methods to this in the form of queries and views. The steps for doing this include: 

•	Creating a conceptual schema in the form of an ER or UML diagram.

•	Deriving a relational schema from the ER diagram.

•	Normalising the relations

•	Implementing this schema by using SQL in Oracle.

•	Populating the database with a set of typical data. The data should be significant but manageable.

•	Defining specialised views which are appropriate to various sub-groups of users.

•	Defining SQL queries which could be used as canned queries for naive users
